Betty helps you visualize and publish your family history by building interactive genealogy websites out of your
[Gramps](https://gramps-project.org/) and [GEDCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM) family trees.

## Features

Betty generates [static sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) from your genealogy records.
This means that once your site has been generated, you will not need any special software to publish it. It's **fast and
secure**.

- Builds pages for people, places, events, and media.
- Renders interactive maps.
- Fully multilingual: localize the site to one or more languages of your choice.
- [Responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), and mobile- and touch-friendly interface.
- Privatization filters for living people.
- [View an example](https://ancestry.bartfeenstra.com/).

### Translations

Betty ships with the following translations:

- US English (`en-US`)
- Dutch (`nl-NL`)
- French (`fr-FR`)
- Ukrainian (`uk`)

Extensions and sites can override these translations, or provide translations for additional locales.

### Gramps

#### Privacy

Gramps has limited built-in support for people's privacy. To fully control privacy for people, as well as events, files,
sources, and citations, add a `betty:privacy` attribute to any of these types, with a value of `private` to explicitly
declare the data always private or `public` to declare the data always public. Any other value will leave the privacy
undecided, as well as person records marked public using Gramps' built-in privacy selector. In such cases, the
`betty.extension.Privatizer` extension may decide if the data is public or private.

#### Dates

For unknown date parts, set those to all zeroes and Betty will ignore them. For instance, `0000-12-31` will be parsed as
"December 31", and `1970-01-00` as "January, 1970".

#### Event types

Betty supports the following Gramps event types:

- `Adopted`
- `Birth`
- `Burial`
- `Baptism`
- `Conference`
- `Confirmation`
- `Correspondence`
- `Cremation`
- `Emigration`
- `Engagement`
- `Death`
- `Divorce`
- `Divorce Filing` (imported as `DivorceAnnouncement`)
- `Funeral`
- `Immigration`
- `Marriage`
- `Marriage Banns` (imported as `MarriageAnnouncement`)
- `Missing`
- `Occupation`
- `Residence`
- `Will`
- `Retirement`

#### Event roles

Betty supports the following Gramps event roles:

- `Attendee`
- `Beneficiary`
- `Celebrant`
- `Family` (imported as `Subject`)
- `Organizer`
- `Primary` (imported as `Subject`)
- `Speaker`
- `Unknown` (imported as `Attendee`)
- `Witness`

#### Order & priority

The order of lists of data, or the priority of individual bits of data, can be automatically determined by Betty in
multiple different ways, such as by matching dates, or locales. When not enough details are available, or in case of
ambiguity, the original order is preserved. If only a single item must be retrieved from the list, this will be the
first item, optionally after sorting.

For example, if a place has multiple names (which may be historical or translations), Betty may try to
filter names by the given locale and date, and then indiscriminately pick the first one of the remaining names to
display as the canonical name.

Tips:

- If you want one item to have priority over another, it should come before the other in a list (e.g. be higher up).
- Items with more specific or complete data, such as locales or dates, should come before items with less specific or
  complete data. However, items without dates at all are considered current and not historical.
- Unofficial names or nicknames, should generally be put at the end of lists.

### GEDCOM files

To build a site from your GEDCOM files:

1. Install and launch [Gramps](https://gramps-project.org/)
1. Create a new family tree
1. Import your GEDCOM file under *Family Trees* > *Import...*
1. Export your family tree under *Family Trees* > *Export...*
1. As output format, choose one of the *Gramps XML* options
1. Follow the documentation to [configure your Betty site](#configuration-files) to load the exported file

### The Python API

```python
from betty.app import App
from betty.asyncio import sync
from betty.generate import generate
from betty.load import load


@sync
async def generate():
    with App() as app:
        await load(app)
        await generate(app)

```

### Environment variables
- `BETTY_CONCURRENCY`: The concurrency factor expressed as an integer. Defaults to the number of CPU cores. Set to `1`
  to disable concurrency altogether.

## Development

First, [fork and clone](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository, and navigate to its root
directory.

### Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/)
- [Xvfb](https://x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml)
- The Cypress 
  [system requirements](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#System-requirements) and 
  [individual packages](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Dependencies) (headless Linux
 only)
- Bash

### Installation

In any existing Python environment, run `./bin/build-dev`.

### Working on translations

#### Making changes to the translatable strings in the source code

Run `betty update-translations` to update the translations files with the changes you made.

#### Adding translations for a language for which no translations exist yet

Run `betty init-translation $locale` where `$locale` is an
[IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47).

#### Updating the translations for a language

First, install a PO file editor on your system. Any will do, but if you don't want to search for one,
[Poedit](https://poedit.net/) is a good and free editor to start with.

Then, with this PO file editor, open and change the `*.po` file for the translations you want to change. For Dutch
(Netherlands), that is [`./betty/assets/locale/nl-NL/betty.po`](betty/assets/locale/nl-NL/betty.po), for example.

### Testing

In any existing Python environment, run `./bin/test`.

### Fixing problems automatically

In any existing Python environment, run `./bin/fix`.
