Betty visualizes and publishes your family history by building interactive, encyclopedia-like genealogy websites out of your
[Gramps](https://gramps-project.org/) and [GEDCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM) family trees.

## Features

Betty generates [static sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) from your genealogy records.
This means that once your site has been generated, you will not need any special software to publish it. It's **fast and
secure**.

- Builds pages for people, places, events, and media.
- Renders interactive maps and family trees
- Privacy by default
- Fully multilingual: localize the site to one or more languages of your choice
- [Responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), and mobile- and touch-friendly interface
- [**View an example**](https://ancestry.bartfeenstra.com/)
