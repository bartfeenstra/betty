npm
===

Some optional parts of Betty use third-party `JavaScript <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript>`_
packages to help build your site.

If Betty shows you an error telling you you need *npm* or *Node.js*, then in order to use that functionality,
you must:

- `install Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_ following the instructions shown there
- ensure ``npm`` (the Node.js package manager) is in your ``PATH``, e.g. that ``npm`` can be run in a terminal
  from anywhere. When running ``npm --help`` in a terminal shows you npm's usage instructions, then you're all set.
