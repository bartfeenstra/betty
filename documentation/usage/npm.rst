Some optional parts of Betty use third-party `JavaScript <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript>`_
packages to help build your site.

If you installed the :doc:`Betty Desktop application </installation/desktop>`, all necessary components
are included, and you will not have to take any additional steps.

If you installed Betty :doc:`via pip </installation/pip>` or :doc:`from source </installation/source>`,
you must also install `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/>`_, which includes npm. Afterwards, ensure ``npm``
is in your ``PATH``, e.g. that ``npm`` can be run in a terminal from anywhere.
