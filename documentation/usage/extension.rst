Betty's functionality can be altered using *extensions*. An extension can do many things, such as loading new or
expanding existing ancestry data, or generating additional content for your site.

Some extensions are configurable. That means that other than enabling them, you can set the configuration options
that determine how the extension should work. This can be done in :doc:`Betty Desktop </installation/desktop>` or
in your project's :doc:`configuration file </usage/project/configuration>` directly.
