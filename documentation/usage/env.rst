Environment variables
=====================

Betty reads the following environment variables:

``BETTY_CACHE_DIRECTORY``
    The path to a directory for Betty to use as its application cache.
    Defaults to ``.betty`` in the current user's home directory.
    This is primarily used for testing an externally running Betty application.
