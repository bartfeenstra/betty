Storytelling
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Betty builds sites that tell a story. Raw family data is visualized in different, sometimes interactive ways.
Additional information is added automatically from a variety of third-party sources, augmenting your family trees
with further encyclopedic information, imagery, and maps.

Simplicity
^^^^^^^^^^
Anyone who can download and install a desktop application should be able to generate a site and view it.
We aim for Betty to be simple to use, out of the box, for everyone.

Speed
^^^^^
Betty sites are fast. Faster than most other sites we use on a daily basis.

Security and maintenance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A Betty site is secure and requires almost no maintenance.

.. important::
    This is about generated sites. You are still advised to install updates to your installation of Betty when they become available.

What is Betty not?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Betty does not help you gather or manage the data for your family history. For that purpose, use a product such as
`Gramps <https://gramps-project.org>`_, or a service like `Ancestry.com <https://www.ancestry.com>`_.
