    <description>
        Betty generates static websites from Gramps and GEDCOM family trees. This means that once your site has been
        generated, you will not need any special software to publish it. It's fast and secure.

        - Builds pages for people, places, events, and media.
        - Renders interactive maps.
        - Fully multilingual: localize the site to one or more languages of your choice.
        - Responsive, and mobile- and touch-friendly interface.
        - Privacy and anonymization filters for living people.
